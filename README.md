# graph_Laplacian

1. A star graph consists of a single central node with N-1 other nodes connected to it. No other
connections exist.
a) Draw a star graph with N=7.
b) Let’s call the central node as Node 1 and the rest of nodes as Node 2, 3, ... N. Show the above
star graph’s Adjacency Matrix.
c) Derive the Laplacian of this graph.
d) Use your favorite programming language and write a code to compute the graph Laplacian based
on your answer of part b. [Hint: yes, this is about matrix subtraction. Do not use any software
package that will directly generate the Laplacian for you.]
2. Repeat Question 1 with N=100 and randomly add exactly w=10 more edges among the leave nodes.
Obviously, you are not supposed to draw this graph by hand in part a) of this question, or even
preassign the adjacency matrix as you might have done in Question 1.
3. Write a program to compute the degree of each node in Question 2 and the average node degree of
the entire graph. Again, please do not use any software package that allows you to call a function and
compute node degrees directly. Write your own few lines of codes to accomplish this.
